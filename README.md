# Public Transport Networks
Public Transport Networks is a networks repository for public transport research. It provides networks as test instances for the following types of problems:
  - Public transport network design problem (NDP)
  - Public transport vehicle and crew scheduling
  - Public transport networks with disturbances
  - Public transport assignment
  - Handling of ridesharing trips

# How the Data is Organized

Each individual network and related files is stored in a separate folder. Each folder contains the following subfolders:
  - Input: provides data describing the transport supply (nodes, stops, links, running times)  and data describing the travel demand (traffic zones, trips between traffic zones)
  - Solution_NDP_Summary: Overview of all solutions for the Network Design Problem
  -	Solution_NDP_Name: Description of a particular solution for the Network Design Problem
